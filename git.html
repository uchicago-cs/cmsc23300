<h1>Using Git<a class="headerlink" href="#using-git" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<blockquote>
<div>This page is based on a lab written by <a class="reference external" href="http://people.cs.uchicago.edu/~larsson/">Gustav Larsson</a> for CMSC 12300</div></blockquote>
<p>In many of your previous CS courses, you became familiar with using Subversion (SVN) to handle <em>revision control</em> (or <em>version control</em>) of your projects and assignments. In this class, we will be using Git instead, which has become the most popular revision control system in the open-source community in recent years. This page provides an overview of Git, and should be enough to get started, specially if you are already familiar with SVN. For a deeper dive into Git, we recommend consulting the <a class="reference external" href="http://git-scm.com/book">Pro Git</a> book (available for free online).</p>
<p>This page will also guide you through creating a GitHub account, which will allow you to experiment with uploading (or &#8220;pushing&#8221;) your Git repository to a remote repository (and, also, because having a GitHub account is a generally useful thing to do). However, please note that, in this class, we will be using a <cite>GitLab &lt;https://about.gitlab.com/</cite>&gt;_ server run by the CS department. Working with GitLab is fairly similar to working with GitHub, but it is very important that you do not upload any of your code from the projects to your GitHub account!</p>
<div class="section" id="git">
<h2>Git<a class="headerlink" href="#git" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>In the olden days (~10 years ago), most open-source projects used primarily CVS or SVN, the latter being a newer replacement of the former. These systems follow a client-server model, where you commit and check out the source code to and from a single server. In our case, that server was PhoenixForge, hosted by the university.</p>
<p>In the last 5-10 years, there has been a move to using distributed revision control systems, where there is no technical distinction between client and server. In this paradigm, each computer has its own self-contained copy of the version history, and updates can be shared between any two computers. This offers a lot more flexibility, that you may or may not experience during this course. I say that, since it can still be used in a client-server manner, which is mainly how we will use it. Luckily, these newer systems also offer many other improvements over their predecessors. Three of the most popular such systems today emerged in 2005 and are called Git, Mercurial and Bazaar. We will be using Git.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="git-basics">
<h2>Git basics<a class="headerlink" href="#git-basics" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Let us look at some of the basics of Git. Since Git is decentralized, we do not need a server to get started. To create a new repository, simply do:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre>$ mkdir new-project
$ cd new-project
$ git init
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>That&#8217;s it, we now have an empty local repository. Try:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre>$ git status
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>It will say <em>nothing to commit</em>, so let us add a file. Create a text file, add some random text and save it as <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">file1.txt</span></code>. If you run <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">git</span> <span class="pre">status</span></code> again, you will see that it lists <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">file1.txt</span></code> under <em>Untracked files</em>. Just like in SVN, run:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre>$ git add file1.txt
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>If you run <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">git</span> <span class="pre">status</span></code> yet again, you will see that the file is now listed under <em>Changes to be committed</em>. Before we commit it, Git needs to know your name and e-mail, which will help identify you in the version history. It is important in this step to specify <strong>the same e-mail as when signing up to GitHub</strong> later in this document. To set this up, please run the following:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre>$ git config user.name &quot;Your Name Here&quot;
$ git config user.email &quot;your_email@example.com&quot;
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Now, go ahead and commit:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre>$ git commit -m &quot;Added file1.txt&quot;
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>As with SVN, if you omit <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">-m</span></code>, it will open up a text editor, which allows you to write longer multi-line commit messages. You can specify which editor you want to use by changing the environment variable <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">GIT_EDITOR</span></code>.</p>
<p>Now, modify <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">file1.txt</span></code> and try running commit again. It will say <em>no changes added to commit</em>, even though we modified the file. This is because Git works a bit different from SVN and requires you to add all modified files for <em>staging</em>, meaning that they will be acknowledged by a commit. This can be done by running <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">git</span> <span class="pre">add</span> <span class="pre">file1.txt</span></code> again, but instead we shall use the shorthand <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">-a</span></code>:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre>$ git commit -a -m &quot;Fixed typo in file1.txt&quot;
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>This will automatically stage all tracked files before committing, giving a similar workflow as <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">svn</span> <span class="pre">commit</span></code>, with one very important distinction: <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">git</span> <span class="pre">commit</span></code> only updates the <em>local</em> repository, whereby <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">svn</span> <span class="pre">commit</span></code> would automatically send the updates to the server. In this example, the local repository is all we have, so let us defer further discussion of this until later.</p>
<p>To remove a file:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre>$ git rm file1.txt
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>If you have modified the file first without committing, Git will complain much like Subversion would. To circumvent this and remove the file anyway, add the flag <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">-f</span></code> as instructions will suggest.</p>
<p>Instead of having only a local repository, we will let GitHub host our projects and use it in a client-server manner.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="github">
<h2>GitHub<a class="headerlink" href="#github" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p><a class="reference external" href="https://github.com">GitHub</a> is a website that offers free hosting of Git repositories for any open-source project, with plenty of additional features that grease the wheels of collaborative work.</p>
<p>For instance, GitHub makes it easy to <em>fork</em> (clone) someone else&#8217;s open-source project, which means you create your own copy of it, where you have free rein. In your cloned version, you can fix bugs, add features or simply experiment in any way that you want. Anyone can use your cloned version, but if you really think your changes would be useful to everyone, then you can open a <em>pull request</em>, to have those changes merged back into the main repository. GitHub makes it easy to manage your repositories, discuss changes, track bugs/issues, create wikis and visualize statistics for your project, and follow the progress of other developers and their projects.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="github-account">
<h2>GitHub account<a class="headerlink" href="#github-account" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>To work through the rest of the instructions in this page, you will need a GitHub account. If you already have one, you can skip this step and simply use your existing account.</p>
<p>Go to <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/">https://github.com/</a> and follow the instructions on how to create an account. This is straightforward. Remember to use the same e-mail as you specified earlier.</p>
<p>Once you have created an account, make sure you add your SSH public key to your account (otherwise, you will only have read-only access to GitHub). You can do this in this page: <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/settings/ssh">https://github.com/settings/ssh</a>. If you do not know what an SSH key is, or do not know how to generate one, read <a class="reference external" href="https://help.github.com/articles/generating-ssh-keys">https://help.github.com/articles/generating-ssh-keys</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="create-a-repository">
<h2>Create a repository<a class="headerlink" href="#create-a-repository" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>In this course, we will create a repository for you on the department&#8217;s GitLab server. However, if you&#8217;re new to Git, you should try creating a repository under your GitHub account so you can experiment and tinker around without fear of messing up your CMSC 23300 repository.</p>
<p>We will create our Git repository through GitHub&#8217;s web interface. Once logged in, you should see several icons in the top right corner, next to your username. Click on the left-most icon, which should say &#8220;Create new..&#8221;. If you click on it, you will have the option to select &#8220;New repository&#8221;. Pick a name for your repository and write a short description.</p>
<p>GitHub only offers free hosting for <em>Public</em> (open-source) projects, and if you select <em>Private</em> you will see that payment options appear. Select <em>Public</em> and also tick the box <em>Initialize this repository with a README</em>.</p>
<p>Finally, GitHub can add an appropriate <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">.gitignore</span></code> for your project if you know what programming language you will be using. The <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">.gitignore</span></code> file will tell Git to hide certain files from <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">git</span> <span class="pre">status</span></code> that should not be commited, such as <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">.o</span></code> files in C or log files.</p>
<p>Once the project is created, you need to create a local clone on your computer.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="cloning-from-github">
<h2>Cloning from GitHub<a class="headerlink" href="#cloning-from-github" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>On your repo&#8217;s front page, you will see a text field on the right column called &#8220;SSH clone URL&#8221;. Select this URL and copy it to your clipboard. Now, go to an appropriate folder in your home directory where you want to put your local copy. Take into account that when we clone (check out) a repository, Git will create a folder with the repo&#8217;s name for us, so there is no need to do that separately. Now, enter <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">git</span> <span class="pre">clone</span></code> followed by pasting from your clipboard, e.g.:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre>$ git clone git@github.com:&lt;username&gt;/&lt;reponame&gt;.git
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Now, you are all set up to interact with the repository as previously described. Please add a file similar to <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">file1.txt</span></code>. This can be a temporary file, in which case you should remove it later.</p>
<p>When the file has been added and committed, it will not automatically appear on GitHub, as it would on PhoenixForge for SVN. Since Git is distributed, committing only means accepting the changes to the local repository. The next step is to push these changes to GitHub. This is done by:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre>$ git push origin master
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>The parameter <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">origin</span></code> tells us to push the change to the place from where we cloned it, and <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">master</span></code> refers to the branch.</p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="first admonition-title">Note</p>
<p class="last">By default, a repo has a single <em>branch</em> and it is called <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">master</span></code>. Branches are used to keep several parallel versions of your source code. You can for instance use a branch for each new feature, and then merge them into <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">master</span></code> once they are done. A more elaborate example of using branches can be seen in the blog post <a class="reference external" href="http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/">A successful Git branching model</a>. Using branches in this way requires a lot more Git fluency, so you will probably just stick with one <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">master</span></code> branch at first.</p>
</div>
<p>The fact that we can work on our project and commit several times without the need to be connected to our SVN server is one of the benefits of distributed revision control.</p>
<p>Finally, to pull changes from GitHub, essentially performing the equivalent of <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">svn</span> <span class="pre">up</span></code>:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre>$ git pull origin master
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>If the remote repository (on GitHub) has changed since you last pulled from it, you will need to run <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">git</span> <span class="pre">pull</span></code> before you can run <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">git</span> <span class="pre">push</span></code>. At this point, there might be a conflict between your changes and someone else&#8217;s that Git can&#8217;t merge automatically. In this case, it will include both versions in the file, looking something like:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre>This is a text file.
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; HEAD:file1.txt
This is version 1.
=======
This is version 2.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
Here is some more text.
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>To resolve this conflict, all you have to do is edit the file in any way that you want as long as you remove the lines with <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;</span></code>, <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">=======</span></code> and <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;</span></code>. When you are done, call <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">git</span> <span class="pre">commit</span> <span class="pre">-a</span></code> as usual. If you run into problems, please post a question on Piazza.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="committing-etiquette">
<h2>Committing etiquette<a class="headerlink" href="#committing-etiquette" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Remember to commit <strong>often</strong> with <strong>descriptive commit messages</strong>. Try to avoid committing code that doesn&#8217;t run into the <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">master</span></code> branch. If it will take a while for your project to be running at all, you should relax this suggestion and still commit often. Please avoid committing files that does not belong in the repository (binaries, logs, etc.), and remove them if you accidentally add them at some point.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="github-vs-gitlab">
<h2>GitHub vs GitLab<a class="headerlink" href="#github-vs-gitlab" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Remember: this page presents GitHub as an easy way for you to get acquainted with how to use a remote Git server. However,
in this class, we will use the CS department&#8217;s GitLab server. <strong>Never upload any of your CMSC 23300 code to GitHub</strong></p>

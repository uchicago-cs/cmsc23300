<div class="section" id="course-description">
<h2>Course description<a class="headerlink" href="#course-description" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>This course focuses on the principles and techniques used in the
development of networked and distributed software. Topics include
programming with sockets; concurrent programming; data link layer
(Ethernet, packet switching, 802.11, etc.); internet and routing
protocols (IP, IPv6, ARP, intra-domain and inter-domain routing, etc.);
end-to-end protocols (UDP, TCP); and other commonly used network
protocols and techniques.</p>
<p>In this course, students will learn how to…</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>…implement multithreaded client/server applications using sockets.</li>
<li>…interpret existing specifications of network protocols, and
translate them into code.</li>
<li>…design and combine network protocols that form the foundation of the
Internet.</li>
<li>…develop software collaboratively through the use of version control
tools, code reviews, and project management.</li>
</ul>
<p>In a nutshell, students will learn how the Internet works. By the end of
this course, students should understand <em>everything</em> that happens “under the hood”
when (for example) a web page is requested, from the moment
you click on a link in your browser to the moment you get the requested
page back.</p>
<p>CMSC 15400 and a working knowledge of the C programming language are
strict prerequisites of this course. Students who have not taken CMSC
15400 must speak with the instructor to verify that they meet the
prerequisites for this course.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="course-organization">
<h2>Course organization<a class="headerlink" href="#course-organization" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The development of three programming projects accounts for the majority
of the grade in this course. To successfully complete these projects,
students must master fundamental concepts and skills in networking. The
class meets two times a week for lectures that provide a conceptual
scaffolding for the projects, but will also cover material that is not
directly applied in the projects. There is also an optional weekly
discussion session primarily intended for in-depth discussion of the
projects. Besides the projects, students will also be evaluated with a
midterm and a final exam. The course calendar, including the contents of
each lecture and project deadlines, is shown in the <a class="reference external" href="calendar.html">Course Calendar</a> page.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="projects">
<h2>Projects<a class="headerlink" href="#projects" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Throughout the quarter, students will develop three projects:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><strong>chirc</strong>: Implementing an Internet Relay Protocol (IRC)
server (partially compliant with RFC 2810, 2811, 2812, and 2813)
using POSIX sockets and pthreads.</li>
<li><strong>chiTCP</strong>: Implementing the Transmission Control Protocol.</li>
<li><strong>chirouter</strong>: Implementing an Internet router using the <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/mininet/mininet">Mininet network emulator</a></li>
</ol>
<p>Each project is independent from the others. Students will develop these
projects in pairs; project groups must be formed by Monday of the
second week of the quarter.
Groups can be changed from one project to another. If your partner drops out of
the course or you feel they are not contributing to the group’s effort,
you should make the instructor aware of this.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="discussion-session">
<h2>Discussion Session<a class="headerlink" href="#discussion-session" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The course includes an optional discussion session which will focus
primarily on the projects. During these discussion sessions, we will (1)
provide suggestions on how to approach the projects, (2) provide general
feedback on submitted projects, and (3) provide a general forum to
answer questions about the projects. For avoidance of doubt, the
discussion sessions are not intended to provide individual feedback or
help on the projects; please use Piazza and office hours for that
purpose.</p>
<p>Even though these discussion sessions are optional and have no direct
impact on your grade, we encourage you to attend them, as they will
provide you with very valuable pointers on how to do the projects. At
the very least, one of the two members in each group should plan to
attend the discussion session each week.</p>
<p>Please note there will be a special session on Thursday,
January 4, from 5:30pm to 8:30pm to provide a refresher on socket
programming and concurrent programming. Students who did not take CMSC 15400 in the previous
school year, or who are not comfortable working with sockets or threads
in C, are <em>strongly</em> encouraged to attend this review session. However,
since it takes place outside of regular class/discussion teams, we understand
that not everyone will be able to make it, and all examples from this
session will be posted online, as well as pointers to reference materials.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="exams">
<h1>Exams<a class="headerlink" href="#exams" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>There will be an in-class midterm half-way through the quarter,
and a final exam will take place during Finals Week. Please
see the <a class="reference external" href="calendar.html">Course Calendar</a> page for the exact dates.</p>
<p>Questions and exercises related to the projects will make up a
substantial part of both exams. Students who have worked on the projects
(which requires understanding the material presented in class) should be
able to answer these questions with relative ease. However, the exams
will also include questions that are not related to the projects, but
will be in line with the learning goals outlined at the beginning of
this syllabus.</p>
<div class="section" id="books">
<h2>Books<a class="headerlink" href="#books" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>This course has two <em>suggested</em> texts:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><em>Computer Networks: A Systems Approach</em>, 5th edition, Larry L.
Peterson and Bruce S. Davie, Morgan Kaufmann 2012.</li>
<li><em>TCP/IP Illustrated, Volume 1: The Protocols</em>, 2nd Edition, Kevin
Fall and W. Richard Stevens, Addison-Wesley 2011.</li>
</ul>
<p>Both are available for purchase from the Seminary Co-op Bookstore. These
texts are <em>not</em> required, and most students are able to complete the
class successfully without them. However, they can be a good complement
to the lectures and projects.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="grading">
<h2>Grading<a class="headerlink" href="#grading" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The final grade will be based on the following:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Project 1: 20%</li>
<li>Project 2: 25%</li>
<li>Project 3: 15%</li>
<li>Midterm: 15%</li>
<li>Final: 25%</li>
</ul>
<p>Grades are not curved in this class or, at least, not in the traditional
sense. We use a standard set of grade boundaries:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>95-100: A</li>
<li>90-95: A-</li>
<li>85-90: B+</li>
<li>80-85: B</li>
<li>75-80: B-</li>
<li>70-75: C+</li>
<li>&lt; 70: Dealt on a case-by-case basis</li>
</ul>
<p>We curve only to the extent that we may (and often do) <em>lower</em> the
boundaries for one or more letter grades, depending on the distribution
of the raw scores. We will never raise the boundaries in response to the
distribution.</p>
<p>Before the end of the quarter, we will provide students with an
estimated grade based on all the work they have done up to that point.
We may also provide a preliminary and non-binding list of grade boundaries.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="types-of-grades">
<h2>Types of grades<a class="headerlink" href="#types-of-grades" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Students may take this course for a quality grade (a “letter” grade) or
a pass/fail grade. By default, we assume students are taking the class
for a quality grade. We will honor all requests to withdraw or take the
class pass/fail <em>before</em> the final exam.</p>
<p>Note: <em>Students taking this course to meet general education
requirements must take the course for a letter grade</em>.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="late-submissions">
<h2>Late submissions<a class="headerlink" href="#late-submissions" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>If you work on the projects with the same partner throughout the quarter,
then the late submission policy is simple: you have four 24-hour extensions
to use at your discretion on any of the projects. Take into account that:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Extensions are all-or-nothing: if you use an extension, you get an indivisible
24-hour extension. You cannot use a portion of an extension
and have the rest “carry over” to another extension.</li>
<li>More than one extension can be applied to a single submission.
e.g., a single 24-hour extension on four submissions, or a 96-hour
extension on a single submission.</li>
<li>You do not need to ask permission to use an extension. Extensions are
handled automatically by the project submission system we use.</li>
<li>Extensions cannot be transferred, sold, or exchanged for points.</li>
</ul>
<p>If extraordinary circumstances (illness, family emergency, etc.) prevent
a student from meeting a deadline, the student must inform the
instructor <em>before</em> the deadline. Requests for extraordinary extensions
after a project deadline will not be considered.</p>
<p>If you work with different partners throughout the quarter, the late submission
policy is slightly more complicated. Each individual student has four extensions,
and using an extension as a pair consumes one extension from each student (so,
if you have the same partner throughout the quarter then you have, as a pair, four extensions
as well). However, if you use one extension with one partner, and then form a different group
with someone who has used two extensions already, then you will only be able to
use two extensions as a pair.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="policy-on-academic-honesty">
<h2>Policy on academic honesty<a class="headerlink" href="#policy-on-academic-honesty" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The University of Chicago has a <a class="reference external" href="http://college.uchicago.edu/advising/academic-integrity-student-conduct">formal policy on academic honesty</a>
that you are expected to adhere to.</p>
<p>Additionally, this class has a <strong>ZERO TOLERANCE</strong> policy on plagiarism
(i.e., handing in someone else’s work as your own, whether it be work
done by another student in the class or available publicly on the Internet).
If we determine you committed plagiarism, you will receive an F in the
class and you will be referred to the Dean of Students in the College for
further adjudication. The College may impose further
penalties, up to and including suspension and expulsion.</p>
<p>Fortunately, avoiding plagiarism is very simple! For the most part, you
just need to make sure you follow these simple rules:</p>
<ul>
<li><p class="first"><strong>DO NOT</strong> ask another student in the class to show you or e-mail you
their code. It doesn’t matter how you want to use it: even if you just
want to skim through their solution for inspiration, this is still
plagiarism. Needless to say, you <strong>MUST NOT</strong> use someone else’s code
(with or without their permission) in your own solution.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Similarly, <strong>DO NOT</strong> show or share your code with another student in the class.
If someone in the class asks you to share your code with them, even if you’re
certain they won’t use it and they just want to look at it to get “unstuck”,
please point them to this part of the syllabus. <em>Take into account
that, if you willingly share your code with someone else, you are
not being a “Good Samaritan”: you are an equally guilty
party in a plagiarism offence, and will also receive an F.</em></p>
</li>
<li><p class="first"><strong>DO NOT</strong> post your code in publicly-accessible websites, like pastebin,
a public GitHub repository, GitHub gists, etc. While it can be a convenient
mechanism to share code with an instructor/TA or with a project partner, it
can also expose your code to other students in the class. You are provided
with a private repository on our GitLab server, and you should use that repository
exclusively to share code with your project partner, or with the instructional
staff.</p>
<p>If you do post your code in a publicly-accessible location, and we find out
about it outside of a plagiarism incident, you will just get a warning. However,
if another student in the class uses code that you posted on such a site (even
if you did not intend for that code to be used by someone else), you will
receive an F in the class.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first"><strong>DO NOT</strong> use code you find on the Internet, except in the very limited
cases described below.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>We realize that sometimes students commit plagiarism out of desperation
and as a measure of last resort. If you are in this situation, please
just ask the instructors for help. If you are having a hard time in the
class, we will provide as much assistance as we can. Plus, a poor performance in
one assignment is unlikely to wreck your grade for the class. Plagiarism
is never worth it.</p>
<p>All that said, we do encourage a collaborative environment in this class,
as long as it doesn’t slip into the realm of plagiarism. If a given
assignment requires you to work with another student, you may share
code with that student only for that assignment. You are also welcome
to <em>discuss</em> aspects of an assignment with other students in the class,
as long as you don’t share or write code together.</p>
<p>Please note that this also included “whiteboarding”: discussing an assignment with
other students by sketching out code on a whiteboard <em>may</em> cross the line into
academic dishonesty (<em>even when using pseudocode</em>). If you do sketch out code on
a whiteboard, do not take pictures of the code or use the code verbatim in your
own solution. You should instead focus on using the whiteboard discussion as
a way to understand the high-level aspects of the problem, and then writing
your own code from scratch.</p>
<p>In any case, if you have discussed parts of an assignment with someone else,
then make sure to say so in your submission (e.g., in a README file or as a
comment at the top of your source code file).</p>
<p>Using outside sources is generally acceptable as long as:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>You cite the source you used.</li>
<li>You do not use verbatim blocks of code from that source.</li>
<li>The source does not provide a complete (or nearly complete) solution
to the assignment.</li>
</ol>
<p>Furthermore, the use of external libraries is generally allowed on all
the projects, as long as they don’t provide networks-related functionality
that you’re expected to implement. If you want to be on the safe side,
you can ask on Piazza whether a given library is ok to use. Please note
that the following libraries are pre-approved, and you are welcome to use them
in your projects (in fact, many students have used them in past years):</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><a class="reference external" href="http://mij.oltrelinux.com/devel/simclist/">simclist</a>: A C library for Lists</li>
<li><a class="reference external" href="http://bstring.sourceforge.net/">bstring</a>: The Better String Library</li>
<li><a class="reference external" href="https://troydhanson.github.io/uthash/">uthash</a>: A hash table for C structures</li>
<li><a class="reference external" href="https://troydhanson.github.io/uthash/utlist.html">utlist</a>: Another linked list library</li>
</ul>
<p>Finally, if you have any questions regarding what would or would not be
considered academic dishonesty in this course, please don’t hesitate to
ask the instructor.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="asking-questions">
<h2>Asking questions<a class="headerlink" href="#asking-questions" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The preferred form of support for this course is through <em>Piazza</em>
(<a class="reference external" href="http://www.piazza.com/">http://www.piazza.com/</a>), an on-line discussion service which can be
used to ask questions and share useful information with your classmates.
Students will be enrolled in Piazza at the start of the quarter.</p>
<p>All questions regarding assignments or material covered in class must be
sent to Piazza, and not directly to the instructors or TAs, as this
allows your classmates to join in the discussion and benefit from the
replies to your question. If you send a message directly to the
instructor or the TAs, you will get a gentle reminder that your question
should be asked on Piazza.</p>
<p>Piazza has a mechanism that allows you to ask a private question, which
will be seen only by the instructors and teaching assistants. This
mechanism should be used <em>only</em> for questions that require revealing
part of your solution to a project.</p>
<p>Piazza also allows students to post anonymously. <em>Anonymous posts will
be ignored</em> (you will also get a gentle reminder asking you to not post
anonymously). This is a majors-level course: you are expected to feel
comfortable sharing your questions and thoughts with your classmates
without hiding behind a veil of anonymity.</p>
<p>Additionally, all course announcements will be made through Piazza. It
is your responsibility to check Piazza often to see if there are any
announcements. Please note that you can configure your Piazza account to
send you e-mail notifications every time there is a new post on Piazza.
Just go to your Account Settings, then to Class Settings, click on “Edit
Notifications” under CMSC 23300. We encourage you to select either the
“Real Time” option (get a notification as soon as there are new posts)
or the “Smart Digest” option (get a summary of all the posts sent over
the last 1-6 hours – you can select the frequency).</p>

<h2>Selecting the commit you want to submit<a class="headerlink" href="#selecting-the-commit-you-want-to-submit" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>To submit a project for grading, you first need to select the specific commit you want us to grade. Commits in git are identified by a SHA-1 hash, and look something like this:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre>4eac77c9f11dfb101dbbbe3e9f2df07c40f9b2f5
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>You can see the list of commits in your repository by running the following:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre>git log
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Or, if you simply want to get the SHA-1 hash of the latest commit in your <cite>master</cite> branch, you can just run this:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre>git rev-parse master
</pre></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="making-the-submission">
<h2>Making the submission<a class="headerlink" href="#making-the-submission" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Once you&#8217;ve identified the commit you want to submit, you need to run the following <strong>BEFORE THE DEADLINE</strong>:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre>chisubmit student assignment submit &lt;team-id&gt; &lt;assignment-id&gt; &lt;commit-sha&gt;
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Where:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">&lt;team-id&gt;</span></code> is your team identifier, which is also your repository name (typically your CNetIDs separated by hyphens).</li>
<li><code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">&lt;assignment-id&gt;</span></code> is the project identifier. Your instructor will tell you what identifier to use, but you can also see the list of possible assignment ids by running <cite>chisubmit student assignment list</cite>.</li>
<li><code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">&lt;commit-sha&gt;</span></code> is the SHA-1 hash of the commit you want to submit.</li>
</ul>
<p>For example, the command could look something like this:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre>chisubmit student assignment submit amr-borja p1a 4eac77c9f11dfb101dbbbe3e9f2df07c40f9b2f5
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>You will be given an opportunity to verify the details of the submission before you actually submit your code. For example, the above command would print something like this:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre>You are going to make a submission for p1a (chirc: Part 1).
The commit you are submitting is the following:

      Commit: 4eac77c9f11dfb101dbbbe3e9f2df07c40f9b2f5

You will have 4 extensions left after this submission.

<p>Before you type &#8220;y&#8221;, <strong>take a moment to ensure that this commit is the one you actually want to submit</strong>. If the commit message and date shown by chisubmit don&#8217;t look right, then you should double-check whether you were able to successfully commit and push your code.</p>
<p>Finally, remember that the above has to be run <em>before the deadline</em>. If you fail to do so, it doesn&#8217;t matter if your code was pushed to the GitLab server before the deadline. For your code to be accepted for grading, you must also run the <cite>chisubmit</cite> submission command before the deadline. The <cite>chisubmit</cite> system will mercilessly stop accepting submissions once the deadline has passed.</p>

PLEASE VERIFY THIS IS THE EXACT COMMIT YOU WANT TO SUBMIT

Your team currently has 4 extensions

You used 0 extensions in your previous submission of this assignment.
and you are going to use 0 additional extensions now.

You will have 4 extensions left after this submission.

<p>Like your first submission, you can only re-submit <em>before the deadline</em>. Once the deadline passes, you cannot modify your submission, not even if you use extensions.</p>
<p>If you make a submission and, before the deadline, you realize you want to use an extension (and re-submit after the deadline with an extension), then you need to make sure you <strong>cancel</strong> your submission before the deadline. For example:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre>chisubmit student assignment cancel-submit amr-borja p1a

<div class="section" id="using-extensions">
<h2>Using extensions<a class="headerlink" href="#using-extensions" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>First of all, please note that you do not need to ask the instructors for permission to use an extension. Please do not e-mail us to ask for permission to use an extension, or even to inform us that you intend to use one. All of this is handled automatically by the chisubmit system. To use an extension, you need to use the <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">--extensions</span></code> option when submitting your assignment. For example:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre>chisubmit student assignment submit &lt;team-id&gt; &lt;project-id&gt; &lt;commit-sha&gt; --extensions &lt;num-extensions&gt;
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>If you are using an extension, you do not need to run this command before the original deadline. Instead, you should allow the original deadline to pass, and then make sure that you make your submission (with the extension) before the extended deadline. So, if the deadline is January 12 at 8pm, and you plan to use two extensions, then the extended deadline is January 14 at 8pm.</p>
<p>chisubmit will validate that the number of extensions you’re requesting is acceptable based on the submission time, the deadline, and the number of extensions you have left. chisubmit will not allow you to submit your code if you try to request too many or not enough extensions (or if you do not have sufficient extensions to make the submission).</p>
<p>For example, you could run the command like this:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre>chisubmit student assignment submit amr-borja p1a 4eac77c9f11dfb101dbbbe3e9f2df07c40f9b2f5 --extensions 1
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Please note that if you amend a submission (using the <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">--force</span></code> parameter) for which you have used extensions, you need
to specify the number of extensions again. This does not mean that you are consuming additional extensions to amend the
submission; you are simply reasserting how many extensions you are using.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="checking-your-remaining-number-of-extensions">
<h2>Checking your remaining number of extensions<a class="headerlink" href="#checking-your-remaining-number-of-extensions" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>To see how many late chips you have left, run this:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre>chisubmit student course show-extensions
</pre></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="making-a-safety-submission">
<h2>Making a safety submission<a class="headerlink" href="#making-a-safety-submission" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Take into account that chisubmit allows you to make multiple submissions before the deadline. A good strategy is to always make a &#8220;safety submission&#8221; well ahead of the deadline. For example, if a project has five tasks, and you have completed four of those tasks but expect to be working on the fifth one right up until the deadline, you should make a submission before you start working on the fifth task. That way, if you end up missing the deadline, there is already a submission in the system with most of your work on it (which may not be as good as a submission with partial or complete work for that fifth task, but still better than not submitting anything at all).</p>
<p><strong>Safety submissions are specially important if you have used all your extensions</strong>. If the deadline passes and you have not made any submissions, and you are out of late chips, that means an automatic zero on that assignment.</p>

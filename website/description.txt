This course focuses on the principles and techniques used in the
development of networked and distributed software. Topics include
programming with sockets; concurrent programming; data link layer
(Ethernet, packet switching, 802.11, etc.); internet and routing
protocols (IP, IPv6, ARP, intra-domain and inter-domain routing, etc.);
end-to-end protocols (UDP, TCP); and other commonly used network
protocols and techniques.

In this course, students will learn how to…

-  ...implement multithreaded client/server applications using sockets.

-  ...interpret existing specifications of network protocols, and
   translate them into code.

-  ...design and combine network protocols that form the foundation of the
   Internet.

-  ...develop software collaboratively through the use of version control
   tools, code reviews, and project management.

In a nutshell, students will learn how the Internet works. By the end of
this course, students should understand *everything* that happens "under the hood"
when (for example) a web page is requested, from the moment
you click on a link in your browser to the moment you get the requested
page back.

CMSC 15400 and a working knowledge of the C programming language are
strict prerequisites of this course. Students who have not taken CMSC
15400 must speak with the instructor to verify that they meet the
prerequisites for this course.

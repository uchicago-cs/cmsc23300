General
~~~~~~~
* `The TCP/IP Guide <http://www.tcpipguide.com/>`_: A comprehensive guide covering many of the topics covered in class. This is a good reference if you need to see further examples, or more in-depth explanations, of something covered in class.

* `The case of the 500-mile email <http://www.ibiblio.org/harris/500milemail.html>`_ (found by Shanthanu Bhardwaj, Networks'15): An amusing story that will resonate with anyone who has suffered through timeout issues in this class. 

Ethernet
~~~~~~~~

* `Reddit AMA with Bob Metcalfe <http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1erq51/youre_probably_connecting_to_reddit_through_a/>`_ (one of the creators of Ethernet)

IP
~~

* `IANA IPv4 Address Space Registry <http://www.iana.org/assignments/ipv4-address-space/ipv4-address-space.xhtml>`_: List of how each /8 network is allocated.
* `Map of the Internet <http://xkcd.com/195/>`_: xkcd's map of the IPv4 address space as of 2006
* `IPv4 map <http://icicle.dylex.net/~ipmap/>`_: A visualization of the IPv4 address space
* `IPv4 Internet Map <http://caia.swin.edu.au/sting/ipmap/index.html>`_: Another visualization of the IPv4 address space

IPv6
~~~~

* `IP6to4 tunnel <http://www.wtfm.org/ip6to4>`_: Script for creating a 6to4 tunnel.


Internet-level Routing
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* `BGP Toolkit <http://bgp.he.net/>`_: Website that provides lots of information about Autonomous Systems (AS), routing prefixes, peers, etc.

TCP
~~~

* `Go-Back-N interactive animation <http://www.ccs-labs.org/teaching/rn/animations/gbn_sr/>`_ (found by George Teo, Networks'16) : After you click start, the packets will travel across the screen. Click a moving packet to have it become "lost". Then the animation will send the appropriate delayed acks and then retransmit all of the pending packets. 

DNS
~~~

* `Root Hints File <http://www.internic.net/domain/named.root>`_: The list of root DNS servers
* `Root Zone File <http://www.internic.net/domain/root.zone>`_: The DNS root zone file (with all the records for the TLDs)

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* `Paid Peering, Paid Prioritization, and the Nuance of the Net Neutrality Debate <https://www.benton.org/node/197702>`_
* `What Everyone Gets Wrong in the Debate Over Net Neutrality <http://www.wired.com/2014/06/net_neutrality_missing/>`_

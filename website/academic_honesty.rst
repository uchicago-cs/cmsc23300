Academic Honesty
----------------

The University of Chicago has a `formal policy on academic honesty <http://college.uchicago.edu/advising/academic-integrity-student-conduct>`_
that you are expected to adhere to. In this page, we elaborate on what we understand by academic honesty, and provide specific rules to ensure that you do not cross the line into academic dishonesty.

Academic dishonesty can encompass many activities, but one of the gravest 
is plagiarism: knowingly handing in someone else’s work as your own, whether 
it be work done by another student in the class or available publicly on 
the Internet. This class has a **ZERO TOLERANCE** policy on plagiarism. If 
we determine you committed plagiarism, you will receive an F in the class 
regardless of how small the offence was. You will also be referred to the 
Dean of Students in the College for further adjudication. The College may 
impose further penalties, up to and including suspension and expulsion.

Please note that plagiarism is fairly easy for us to detect: we use a series 
of automated tools that look for similarities between your code and other 
students’ code (across all sections of the class), including code submitted 
in previous offerings of this class. If you use someone else’s code, it is 
very likely you will get caught and, to reiterate, you will then automatically 
receive an F in the class.

Fortunately, avoiding plagiarism is very simple! For the most part, you 
just need to follow these rules:

* **DO NOT** ask another student in the class to show you or e-mail you 
  their code. It doesn't matter how you want to use it: even if you just
  want to skim through their solution for inspiration, this is still
  plagiarism. Needless to say, you **MUST NOT** use someone else's code
  (with or without their permission) in your own solution.
* Similarly, **DO NOT** show or share your code with another student in the class.
  If someone in the class asks you to share your code with them, even if you're
  certain they won't use it and they just want to look at it to get "unstuck",
  please point them to this part of the syllabus. *Take into account
  that, if you willingly share your code with someone else, you are 
  not being a "Good Samaritan": you are an equally guilty
  party in a plagiarism offence, and will also receive an F.*
* **DO NOT** post your code in publicly-accessible websites, like pastebin,
  a public GitHub repository, GitHub gists, etc. While it can be a convenient 
  mechanism to share code with an instructor/TA or with a project partner, it 
  can also expose your code to other students in the class. You are provided
  with a private repository on our GitLab server, and you should use that repository
  exclusively to share code with your project partner, or with the instructional
  staff.

  If you do post your code in a publicly-accessible location, and we find out
  about it outside of a plagiarism incident, you will just get a warning. However, 
  if another student in the class uses code that you posted on such a site (even
  if you did not intend for that code to be used by someone else), you will
  receive an F in the class.
* **DO NOT** use code you find on the Internet, except in the very limited
  cases described below.

By themselves, the above academically dishonest behaviors won’t necessarily 
cross the line into plagiarism (or earn you an automatic F in the class), 
but you may still receive a stern warning if we catch you doing any of the above.

We realize that sometimes students commit plagiarism out of desperation
and as a measure of last resort. If you are in this situation, please
just ask the instructors for help. If you are having a hard time in the
class, we will provide as much assistance as we can. Plus, a poor performance in
one assignment is unlikely to wreck your grade for the class. Plagiarism
is never worth it.

All that said, we do encourage a collaborative environment in this class,
as long as it doesn't slip into the realm of plagiarism. If a given
assignment requires you to work with another student, you may share
code with that student only for that assignment. You are also welcome
to *discuss* aspects of an assignment with other students in the class,
as long as you don't share or write code together. 

Please note that this also includes "whiteboarding": discussing an assignment with
other students by sketching out code on a whiteboard *may* cross the line into 
academic dishonesty (*even when using pseudocode*). If you do sketch out code on
a whiteboard, do not take pictures of the code or use the code verbatim in your
own solution. You should instead focus on using the whiteboard discussion as
a way to understand the high-level aspects of the problem, and then writing
your own code from scratch.

In any case, if you have discussed parts of an assignment with someone else, 
then make sure to say so in your submission (e.g., in a README file or as a 
comment at the top of your source code file). 

Using outside sources is generally acceptable as long as:

1. You cite the source you used.
2. You do not use verbatim blocks of code from that source.
3. The source does not provide a complete (or nearly complete) solution 
   to the assignment.

Some sources may provide small code examples that are used to illustrate a 
concept. We encourage you to never use those examples verbatim in your code, 
but we understand that, in some cases, your own code may be reasonably similar 
to those examples (e.g., because there are very few ways in which a given 
piece of code could be written). To ensure this is not flagged as plagiarism, 
always err on the side of including a citation.

Furthermore, the use of external libraries is generally allowed on all
the projects, as long as they don't provide networks-related functionality 
that you're expected to implement. If you want to be on the safe side,
you can ask on Piazza whether a given library is ok to use. Please note
that the following libraries are pre-approved, and you are welcome to use them
in your projects (in fact, many students have used them in past years):

- `utlist <https://troydhanson.github.io/uthash/utlist.html>`_: A linked list library
- `uthash <https://troydhanson.github.io/uthash/>`_: A hash table for C structures
- `SDS <https://github.com/antirez/sds>`_: Simple Dynamic Strings
- `bstring <http://bstring.sourceforge.net/>`_: The Better String Library

Finally, if you have any questions regarding what would or would not be
considered academic dishonesty in this course, please don’t hesitate to
ask the instructor.

Using Git
---------

In many of your previous CS courses, you became familiar with using Subversion (SVN) to handle *revision control* (or *version control*) of your projects and assignments. In this class, we will be using Git instead, which has become the most popular revision control system in the open-source community in recent years. 

If you are unfamiliar with Git, we suggest you work through the `Git lab <https://uchicago-cs.github.io/cmsc22000/labs/lab1/>`__ from CMSC 22000, with the following differences:

* Instead of using your CMSC 23300 repository (on the department's `GitLab server <https://mit.cs.uchicago.edu/>`__), we suggest you create a `GitHub <https://github.com/>`__ account to experiment with Git.
* In the lab, under "Initializing your repository", ignore references to https://mit.cs.uchicago.edu and GitLab. Instead, `create a repository <https://help.github.com/articles/create-a-repo/>`__ on GitHub (we suggest you call it ``git-sandbox``), and `clone it <https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository/>`__ on your computer.
* The lab includes a number of tasks that will require figuring out some Git commands on your own. Don't skip these; they can be a really valuable exercise!
* If you do use GitHub to play around with Git, **do not upload any of your CMSC 23300 code to GitHub!!!** In this class, you *must* work on your projects using the repository that is created for you in the department's `GitLab server <https://mit.cs.uchicago.edu/>`__. You are welcome to use GitHub to familiarize yourself with Git, but you should not upload any CMSC 23300 code there. Doing so is a potential `academic honesty <academic_honesty.html>`__ violation!

At a later time (probably once you're done with Project 1a), you may also want to work through the `Advanced Git lab <https://uchicago-cs.github.io/cmsc22000/labs/lab1/>`__ from CMSC 22000 (you should skip the "Pull requests" or "Code reviews with pull requests" sections).

Once you have mastered branches and merging, you may want to read `A successful Git branching model <https://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/>`__.
